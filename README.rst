Django-fbcanvas
################################################################################

Utility application specifically designed to facilitate creation of Facebook
canvas applications with Django.

This project is derived from `rshk's fork`_ of `Django-facebook`_.
Many of the code is taken from that project, and I will probably
try to integrate the two things once this project is more mature.

I started writing this from scratch, since I need to have something usable
for canvas apps quickly, while I don't need the OAuth-login so much
for now..
